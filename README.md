## 🏢 About

**JAE Collective** is a two-person web development agency founded by Jashmine Verdida and Eijay Pepito. This repository contains the source code for our agency's team portfolio website — a fully responsive, production-ready site built with HTML5, custom CSS3, and Bootstrap 5.

The portfolio showcases our team, skillsets, and the projects we have delivered — all wrapped in a tech-forward design with a dark charcoal + teal accent color palette, hexagonal geometric motifs, and smooth scroll animations.

> **Note:** If an image file is missing, the site gracefully falls back to branded placeholder images using `placehold.co` and `ui-avatars.com` — so the layout never breaks.

## 💻 Running Locally

This project requires **no build tools, no npm, no dependencies to install**. It runs entirely in the browser.

### Steps

**1. Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ClubEijay/JAE-Portfolio.git
cd JAE-Portfolio
```

**2. Add your image assets**

Place all required images into the `/images` folder using the filenames listed in the [Image Assets Reference](#-image-assets-reference) section below.

If you skip this step, the site will display placeholder images automatically — nothing will be broken.

**3. Open in a browser**

Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser:

```bash
# macOS
open index.html

# Windows (PowerShell)
start index.html

# Linux
xdg-open index.html
```

Or, for a better local development experience, use the **Live Server** extension in VS Code:
1. Install [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) in VS Code.
2. Right-click `index.html` → **Open with Live Server**.
